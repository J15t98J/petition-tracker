Originally inspired by [Brexit Petitions Count](https://brexit-petitions-count.now.sh/) during the swell of signatures for the [Revoke Article 50 petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584), Petition Tracker seeks to provide insight into how UK Parliament Petitions perform during their six-month run. Tracked open petitions are crawled via Firebase every five minutes for analysis by the Single-Page Application at [petitions.tylerjon.es](https://petitions.tylerjon.es).
